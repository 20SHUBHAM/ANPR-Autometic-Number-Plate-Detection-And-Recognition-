Introduction
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately recognize and read license plates from images or video streams.

Project Overview
The project involves the following main components:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collecting a diverse set of images containing vehicle license plates and preprocessing them for model training.
Model Training: Training a deep learning model to detect and recognize characters on the license plates.
Inference: Using the trained model to perform real-time or batch processing of images/videos to recognize license plates.
Features
License plate detection and localization
Character recognition on detected license plates
Real-time processing of video streams
Batch processing of images
Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/20SHUBHAM/ANPR-Autometic-Number-Plate-Detection-And-Recognition.git
cd ANPR-Autometic-Number-Plate-Detection-And-Recognition
Install the required dependencies (make sure to add any dependencies your project uses):

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
Usage
Running the ANPR system
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python anpr.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
or for real-time video processing:

bash
Copy code
python anpr.py --video_path path/to/your/video.mp4
Arguments:

--image_path: Path to the image file for license plate recognition.
--video_path: Path to the video file for real-time license plate recognition.
Example
bash
Copy code
python anpr.py --image_path sample_data/car.jpg
Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of images of vehicles with visible license plates. The images should be labeled with bounding boxes around the license plates and the corresponding text annotations for the characters.

Download Dataset: Car Plate Detection Dataset on Kaggle
Model Training
The model training involves the following steps:

Prepare the dataset: Ensure that the dataset is in the correct format and split into training and validation sets.

Train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --dataset_path path/to/dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 16
Arguments:

--dataset_path: Path to the dataset directory.
--epochs: Number of epochs for training.
--batch_size: Batch size for training.
Results
Model Performance: [Include details about the model's accuracy, precision, recall, etc.]
Example Outputs: [Include example images with detected and recognized license plates]
