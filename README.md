## Introduction

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately recognize and read license plates from images or video streams.

---

## Project Overview

The project involves the following main components:
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Collecting a diverse set of images containing vehicle license plates and preprocessing them for model training.
- **Model Training:** Training a deep learning model to detect and recognize characters on the license plates.
- **Inference:** Using the trained model to perform real-time or batch processing of images/videos to recognize license plates.

## Features

- License plate detection and localization
- Character recognition on detected license plates
- Real-time processing of video streams
- Batch processing of images

## Usage

### Running the ANPR System

Run the script for image processing:

For real-time video processing:

#### Arguments:
- `--image_path`: Path to the image file for license plate recognition.
- `--video_path`: Path to the video file for real-time license plate recognition.

**Example:**


---

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model consists of images of vehicles with visible license plates. The images should be labeled with bounding boxes around the license plates and the corresponding text annotations for the characters.

**Download Dataset:** [Car Plate Detection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection)

## Model Training

The model training involves the following steps:

1. Prepare the dataset: Ensure that the dataset is in the correct format and split into training and validation sets.

2. Train the model:

#### Arguments:
- `--dataset_path`: Path to the dataset directory.
- `--epochs`: Number of epochs for training.
- `--batch_size`: Batch size for training.
